title: Oracle GoldenGate 12c Fundamentals for Oracle Ed 1 LVC
---

I am glad that I had already done the Golden Gate tutorials before I attended this class. The labs were great and fun to do so I think the class itself was OK. However the instructor did not know the material and could not understand the students questions. It was a very large Live Virtual Class across multiple time zones. The instructor was in India so the class ran till 2:30AM for her. I would recommend the class but not the instructor.
